"""POST /notes-generate — full port of backend/functions/notes-generate.js.

Handles all four modes the frontend uses:
  - mode='analyze'  → group pages into sections (currently returns an
                     empty list so the frontend falls back to its fixed
                     page-window splits — preserves the existing UX).
  - mode='section'  → notes/summary for one explicit page range,
                     returned as raw markdown (caller merges later).
  - mode='merge'    → merge a list of section markdowns into one note
                     and persist it.
  - mode='generate' → full-document notes/summary in one shot.

Each branch returns the exact JSON shape the frontend (notes-panel.js)
already expects, so the JS handler can be a thin auth+forward shell.

Before choosing sections, silently classify the material as one of:

- **math-heavy**: formulas, derivations, solved examples, calculation methods dominate.
  Examples: Mathematics, Mechanics, Statistics, Physics calculations, Circuits, Thermodynamics.
- **concept-light-math**: definitions, classifications, process descriptions, but small
  calculations or parameters may appear.
  Examples: Fertigungstechnik, Materials Science, Manufacturing, Chemistry theory, Economics concepts.
- **no-math**: purely conceptual — no formulas. Understanding, comparing, arguing, explaining.
  Examples: History, Law, Political Science, Literature, Philosophy, Management, Languages.
- **balanced**: both conceptual theory AND formulas/calculations are central.
  Examples: Physics, Economics, Chemistry, Engineering Science, Finance, Data Science.

## SECTION TEMPLATES — use the one matching the detected type

### IF math-heavy:
OMIT sections that would be empty:
- Topic Overview (1-2 sentences: what this is about)
- Core Definitions (key terms, cited)
- Main Formulas / Theorems (KaTeX, meaning of each, conditions for use)
- When to Use Which Formula (decision guide: "If … → use …")
- Important Derivation Idea (if relevant — the intuition, not the full proof)
- Common Traps (sign errors, unit confusion, wrong formula choice)
- Mini Solved Example (one compact worked example showing the method)
- Exam-Style Checklist (what to know cold)
- Source Pages

### IF concept-light-math:
OMIT sections that would be empty:
- Simple Definition (core term defined clearly)
- Course Classification (where this fits in the broader topic)
- Main Categories (all groups, subcategories — list completely)
- Important Details from Sources (key facts, properties, DIN norms, parameters)
- Comparison Table (markdown table: Type | Principle | Application | Advantage | Disadvantage)
- Selection Criteria (how to choose the right method/process for a scenario)
- Typical Applications (real-world use cases from the material)
- Exam Traps (confusing similar terms, wrong classifications)
- Quick Revision List (the key points to memorize)

Do NOT write "No formula found". Use the concept sections above instead.

### IF no-math:
OMIT sections that would be empty:
- Main Point (one sentence capturing the core idea)
- Key Terms (term + definition pairs, cited)
- Background / Context (historical, legal, social, theoretical context)
- Main Arguments or Ideas (the 3-6 most important ideas)
- Important Relationships (cause-effect, comparisons, connections)
- Comparison Table (if useful — viewpoints, theories, rules side by side)
- Typical Exam Question (a realistic question inferred from the material)
- Short Model Answer (how to structure the answer)
- What to Memorize (key terms, dates, names, rules)

For no-math subjects, the summary should help the student explain and write, not calculate.

### IF balanced:
OMIT sections that would be empty:
- Concept Overview (what the topic is about and why it matters)
- Key Definitions (core terms, cited)
- Important Formulas (KaTeX, with meaning of each variable)
- When Formulas Apply (conditions and decision guide)
- Concept-to-Formula Connection (how the theory leads to the formula)
- Example Calculation (one compact worked example)
- Interpretation (what the result means, typical values, edge cases)
- Common Mistakes (both conceptual and calculation errors)
- Exam Checklist (concepts + formulas + interpretation patterns)

The key for balanced summaries: Meaning → Formula → Calculation → Interpretation."""


def _exam_section_instructions() -> str:
    return """## EXAM SUMMARY MODE — COMPLETENESS IS CRITICAL

You must extract ALL exam-relevant concepts from EVERY page in the provided text.
Do NOT skip pages. Do NOT pick only a few topics. Scan the ENTIRE provided text systematically.

Target length: up to ~4000 words. Be as thorough as needed to cover every exam-relevant concept.
Only infer exam relevance from emphasis in the PDF, repeated concepts, definitions, formulas,
examples, or explicitly marked learning goals. Do NOT invent exam questions from outside knowledge.

## STEP 1: CLASSIFY THE CONTENT TYPE (internal — do NOT output the classification)

Before choosing a structure, silently classify the material as one of:

- **math-problem-solving**: The material is dominated by formulas, derivations, solved examples,
  calculation methods, proofs, or exercise patterns. Examples: Mathematics, Mechanics, Statistics,
  Physics calculations, Signals & Systems.

- **technical-conceptual**: The material mixes engineering knowledge (definitions, DIN norms,
  classifications, process descriptions, material properties) with technical formulas. Examples:
  Fertigungstechnik, Werkstoffkunde, Konstruktionslehre, Thermodynamik.

- **memorization-heavy**: The material is dominated by definitions, classifications, lists, facts,
  comparisons, legal rules, or descriptive theory with few or no calculations. Examples: Biology,
  Law, Medicine theory, Business/Management, History.

- **mixed**: The material contains roughly equal parts of the above.

## STEP 2: USE THE MATCHING STRUCTURE

### IF math-problem-solving:
Use these sections — OMIT any that would be empty:

## 1. Kernformeln (Core Formulas)
Every formula from the PDF in KaTeX, grouped by topic. For each formula: what it computes,
meaning of every variable with units, and under which conditions it applies.

## 2. Wann welche Formel? (When to Use Each Formula)
Decision guide: for each formula, state the typical problem setup that requires it.
Use a compact "If … → use …" format.

## 3. Standard-Lösungsmethoden (Standard Solving Methods)
Step-by-step procedures for the main problem types in the PDF. Number each step.
Include which formula to apply at each step and what to check.

## 4. Typische Aufgabentypen (Typical Exercise Types)
List the exercise patterns that appear in the PDF or can be inferred from the formulas and examples.
For each: one-line description of the setup, which method applies, and what the expected result looks like.

## 5. Mini-Rechenbeispiele (Mini Solved Examples)
Reproduce solved examples from the PDF. If no full example exists but a formula is demonstrated
with numbers, show that. Do NOT invent examples — only use what the PDF provides.

## 6. Typische Fehler (Common Mistakes)
Calculation traps: sign errors, unit confusion, wrong formula choice, forgetting boundary conditions.
Infer ONLY from the material.

## 7. Prüfungs-Checkliste (Exam Checklist)
The 10-15 things to know cold: key formulas, method steps, definitions, special cases.

### IF memorization-heavy:
Use these sections — OMIT any that would be empty:

## 1. Muss-Definitionen (Must-Know Definitions)
Every formal definition, quoted near-verbatim with page references.

## 2. Einteilungen und Klassifikationen (Classifications)
Every classification, taxonomy, or categorization. List all categories completely.

## 3. Wichtige Konzepte (Key Concepts)
Core ideas, principles, theories, and their relationships. Explain each concisely.

## 4. Vergleiche (Comparisons)
Differences and similarities between concepts, methods, or categories. Use markdown tables.

## 5. Beispiele aus der Vorlesung (Lecture Examples)
Examples used in the PDF to illustrate concepts. Cite pages.

## 6. Prüfungsrelevante Fakten (Exam-Relevant Facts)
Facts, numbers, properties, or rules the student must memorize. Bullet list format.

## 7. Typische Prüfungsfragen (Typical Exam Questions)
Questions that can be inferred from the material. Do NOT invent questions from outside knowledge.

## 8. Typische Fehler (Common Mistakes)
Confusing similar terms, wrong classifications, incomplete lists. Infer ONLY from the material.

## 9. Mini-Zusammenfassung (Mini Recap)
3-5 memory-friendly sentences capturing the most critical points.

### IF technical-conceptual:
Use these sections — OMIT any that would be empty:

## 1. Muss-Definitionen (Must-Know Definitions)
Every formal definition in the PDF, quoted near-verbatim with page references.
Include DIN/norm definitions, technical terms, and key distinctions.
Start with the most fundamental definition of the chapter topic.

## 2. Einteilungen und Klassifikationen (Classifications & Tables)
Every classification scheme, taxonomy, or categorization from the PDF.
List all categories and subcategories completely.

## 3. Physikalische Grundlagen (Physical Mechanisms)
Physical principles, material properties, deformation behavior, crystal structures,
microstructural phenomena — anything that explains WHY processes work.

## 4. Wichtige Formeln (Important Formulas)
Every formula from the PDF. For each: the formula in KaTeX, meaning of every variable with units,
and when/how to apply it.

## 5. Was die Formeln bedeuten (What the Formulas Mean)
Practical interpretation: what changes when a variable increases? What are typical values?
Connect formulas to the physical concepts from section 3.

## 6. Verfahren und Prozessschritte (Methods and Process Steps)
Every named method or process with: what it is, how it works, advantages, disadvantages, applications.

## 7. Vergleiche (Exam-Relevant Comparisons)
Comparisons between methods, materials, processes, or concepts. Use markdown tables.
Reproduce table structures faithfully — keep all original columns and values.

## 8. Typische Fehler (Common Mistakes)
Confusing similar terms, wrong column values in tables (e.g. slip planes vs. total slip systems),
mixing up related formulas, forgetting conservation laws. Infer from the material.

## 9. Mini-Zusammenfassung (Mini Recap)
3-5 sentences: the most important things to remember for the exam.

### IF mixed:
Combine elements from the above templates. Use technical-conceptual as the base structure,
but add "Standard-Lösungsmethoden" and "Typische Aufgabentypen" sections if the material
contains calculation methods or exercises.

## COVERAGE TRANSPARENCY
After your content-type marker, output a brief coverage line:
> **Abgedeckte Seiten:** S. X–Y (von Z Seiten im Dokument).
If the provided text does NOT cover the entire PDF, add:
> Wichtige Themen ab S. [first uncovered page] (z. B. [topic names if inferable from headings/ToC]) sind in diesem Bereich nicht enthalten.
Only name topics you can actually see mentioned in a table of contents, chapter heading, or cross-reference within the provided text. Do NOT guess or invent topic names.

## TABULAR DATA PRECISION
When reproducing tables from the PDF (e.g. crystal structures, material properties):
- Copy every column header exactly as it appears in the source.
- Do NOT merge or rename columns. If the PDF has separate columns for "Bevorzugte Gleitebenen",
  "Gleitrichtungen", and "Gleitsystemanzahl", reproduce all three — do not collapse them into fewer columns.
- Cross-check each cell value against the [S. X] source page. A number that belongs to one column
  must not be placed under a different column header."""

- If a section would be empty, OMIT it entirely — never write "keine vorhanden" or similar.
- Math in KaTeX ($...$ or $$...$$). Use proper subscripts and superscripts: write $k_f$, $A_0$, $A_1$, $l_0$, $l_1$, $\\varphi$, $\\varepsilon$ — never write plain kf, A0, A1.
- Prefer $\\varphi = \\ln(1+\\varepsilon) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{{l_1}}{{l_0}}\\right)$ when the source discusses logarithmic strain / Umformgrad.
- Tables with markdown for comparisons.

- **technical-conceptual**: engineering knowledge (definitions, DIN norms, classifications, processes) mixed with formulas.
- **memorization-heavy**: definitions, classifications, lists, facts, comparisons, descriptive theory.
- **mixed**: roughly equal parts.

Then use the matching template from the exam section instructions:
- math-problem-solving → Kernformeln, Wann welche Formel, Standard-Lösungsmethoden, Typische Aufgabentypen, Mini-Rechenbeispiele, Typische Fehler, Prüfungs-Checkliste
- technical-conceptual → Muss-Definitionen, Einteilungen, Physikalische Grundlagen, Wichtige Formeln, Was die Formeln bedeuten, Verfahren, Vergleiche, Typische Fehler, Mini-Zusammenfassung
- memorization-heavy → Muss-Definitionen, Einteilungen, Wichtige Konzepte, Vergleiche, Vorlesungsbeispiele, Prüfungsrelevante Fakten, Typische Prüfungsfragen, Typische Fehler, Mini-Zusammenfassung
- mixed → technical-conceptual base + Standard-Lösungsmethoden and Typische Aufgabentypen if calculation content exists

OMIT sections that would be empty.

Coverage rules:
- Preserve exam-relevant content from EVERY input section. Do not drop middle pages or later page ranges.
- Remove exact duplicates only. Consolidate repeated ideas, but keep unique details and page refs.
- Cite pages only when the input already has *(S. X)* or an explicit section page range. Never guess page numbers.
- Do not move page references between concepts. If examples are on S. 6, keep S. 6.
- Preserve all formal definitions, DIN classifications, lists, formulas, diagrams, and comparisons.
- Preserve table structures faithfully — keep all original columns and their correct per-row values. Do NOT merge or rename columns from the source.
- Keep formulas in clean KaTeX with engineering subscripts: $k_f$, $A_1$, $l_1$, $l_0$, $\\varphi$, $\\varepsilon$.
- Prefer $\\varphi = \\ln(1+\\varepsilon) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{{l_1}}{{l_0}}\\right)$ when the source supports it.
- Add Typische Fehler that follow from the source, for example confusing $\\varphi$ with $\\varepsilon$, confusing the number of slip planes with total slip systems, or forgetting Volumenkonstanz, but do not invent unrelated traps.
- Omit a final heading only if no input section contains any real content for it.
- Remove all partial <!-- minallo-summary-type: ... --> markers and output exactly ONE marker first.
- Do NOT invent new information.

Coverage transparency:
- After the content-type marker, output a coverage line:
  > **Abgedeckte Seiten:** S. X–Y (von Z Seiten im Dokument).
  Use the page ranges from the input section headers to determine X–Y. If total pages is unknown, omit "von Z".
- If the merged content clearly does not cover the entire PDF (e.g. early pages only, or a table of contents mentions topics not found in any input section), add:
  > Wichtige Themen ab S. [first uncovered page] (z. B. [topic names visible in ToC/headings]) sind in diesem Bereich nicht enthalten.

Choose based on the merged result:
- If ALL partial summaries are content-light → use content-light and output one compact note.
- If some are content-light and others contain study content → use mixed-content.
- If all contain study content → use study-content.

Rules:
- Remove all partial <!-- minallo-summary-type: ... --> markers from the input sections. Output exactly ONE marker as the first line.
- Preserve ALL content from ALL sections — do not aggressively shorten.
- Remove exact duplicates only.
- Keep every page reference *(S. X)*.
- Preserve ALL formulas and definitions exactly as written.
- Group by topic under ## headings.
- Every method/process keeps its own ### subsection.
- OMIT sections that would be empty.
- End with ## Prüfungsrelevanz (only if study content exists).
- Do NOT invent new information."""
