"""Phase 10 — deterministic verification of generated answers.

Independent of the model's self-reported confidence. Cross-checks the
answer text against the retrieved chunks (and the user's question) and
returns a structured ``VerificationResult``:

  status   : "verified" | "partially_verified" | "missing_context"
  reasons  : list of plain-English explanations for the chosen status
  details  : machine-readable breakdown the frontend / debug log can show

Checks (cheap, no LLM, no DB):

  1. **Citation present** — when chunks were used, the answer must include
     at least one ``[Source N]`` or ``(filename, p.N)`` reference.
  2. **Formula grounding** — every ``$$ ... $$`` block in the answer must
     appear (token-similar) in some chunk.
  3. **Number grounding** — every standalone numeric token in the answer
     must appear in some chunk OR in the user's question. Tolerant of
     unit suffixes (``200 N``, ``0.5 m``).
  4. **Self-report parse** — if the model wrote ``Missing context`` or
     ``Partially verified`` in its final section, we honour it as a
     floor (the deterministic checks can only downgrade, never upgrade).

Failures collapse to the lowest applicable status. Anything we can't
check (e.g. model produced no chunks at all) collapses to
``missing_context``.
