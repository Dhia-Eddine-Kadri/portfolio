"""Deep Learn guided tutor lessons.

Deep Learn teaches one course topic step by step from the student's uploaded
materials. It retrieves separate evidence buckets (definitions, formulas,
lecture explanations, exercises, common traps, related concepts), checks that
the topic is actually covered, then asks the model for a strict structured
lesson object that the frontend can render as academic learning sections.

    "3. lessonMode — exam mode label\n"
    "4. citationWarning — source quality notice (if needed)\n"

    "═══ SECTION QUALITY RULES ═══\n\n"
    "learningGoal: Must be OUTCOME-BASED with bulleted list. Not \"Understand the topic\" "
    "but \"Nach dieser Lektion kannst du: 1. den Begriff definieren, 2. die wichtigsten "
    "Unterpunkte unterscheiden, 3. typische Prüfungsfragen beantworten, 4. Fehler und "
    "Prüfungsfallen erkennen, 5. das Thema auf ein Beispiel anwenden.\" For math topics: "
    "\"...die zentrale Formel erklären, die Bedingungen prüfen, Aufgaben Schritt für Schritt "
    "lösen, Einheiten und Vorzeichen kontrollieren, typische Prüfungsfallen vermeiden.\"\n\n"
    "bigPicture: Explain where the topic belongs, why it matters, and how it is typically "
    "examined (definitions, comparisons, applications, calculations, case questions).\n\n"
    "simpleExplanation: Explain the idea in plain student-friendly language before any "
    "technical detail. For technical subjects make it concrete; for theory make it intuitive; "
    "for math explain the idea before formulas.\n\n"
    "coreExplanation: The main teaching section. Organize the concept clearly: main idea, "
    "sub-concepts, conditions/limitations, exam relevance. Every claim from source facts. "
    "Write like a tutor coaching for the exam, not an encyclopedia. Add inline exam notes "
    "like \"Merksatz für die Prüfung: ...\" or \"Prüfungsfalle: ...\".\n\n"
    "keyDetails: Source-grounded facts. Each should reference a source. Built from extracted "
    "structure: slide titles, bullet groups, tables, numbers, definitions, formulas, "
    "examples, captions, warnings, process names, case studies.\n\n"
    "commonMistakes: SPECIFIC, not generic. Not \"Students often misunderstand the topic\" "
    "but \"Confusing X with Y\" or \"Using the formula outside its valid assumptions\".\n\n"
    "examTraps: Each trap should state the trap, why it is wrong, and the correct idea.\n\n"
    "selfCheck: 3 types: 1. Basic understanding (definition), 2. Application (classify, "
    "calculate, argue, apply), 3. Exam trap (comparison, edge case). Each with hint, "
    "answer, explanation, stepByStep.\n\n"
    "practiceTasks: Use difficulty levels. Each with prompt, goal, source basis.\n\n"
    "nextStep: Guide the student — suggest related topics and recommend a practice type. "
    "Example: \"Als Nächstes solltest du X mit Y vergleichen, weil solche "
    "Abgrenzungsfragen häufig in Prüfungen vorkommen.\"\n\n"
    "groundedSources: ONLY directly relevant sources. Include a sourceRole for each: "
