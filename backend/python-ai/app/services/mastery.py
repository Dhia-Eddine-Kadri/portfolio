"""Phase 3 — read/write helpers for user_topic_mastery.

Reads power the "coaching note" the answer-pipeline injects into the
system prompt when a student asks a question that may touch a topic they
have previously struggled with. Writes power the Schreibtrainer →
mastery unification: every high-severity, actual-error feedback item
turns into one incorrect attempt on a German grammar topic so writing
weaknesses and course-quiz weaknesses live in one table.
