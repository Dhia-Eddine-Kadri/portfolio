# The previous +0.25 active-doc boost was larger than the typical similarity
# spread (~0.10-0.35), so chunks from the open doc swamped top-K even when
# another doc held the actual answer. Drop to a tie-breaker level — enough
# to win when similarity is comparable, but not enough to override a
# materially more relevant chunk from a different document.
# Active-doc boost tuning — three failure modes seen in real sessions:
#   * 0.10 (original): open PDF lost the top-K entirely to bigger /
#     keyword-denser docs. AG_9.1 had ZERO chunks in the top 12 for a
#     Nachgiebigkeit question — old Klausuren took every slot.
#   * 1.00 (first attempt): open PDF took ALL 12 top slots. Formelzettel
#     never made it in — model fell back to a generic δ = L/(A·E) textbook
#     formula.
#   * 0.40 (second attempt): better balance, but AG_9.1 still took 5-6
#     slots and Formelzettel only got 1-2 slots at the BOTTOM of top-12,
#     where the model under-reads them.
# 0.25 is the current compromise. With exercise-exact prepended (score 99)
# the active doc already has its statement chunk locked in slot 1; we
# don't need the boost to also dominate slots 2-12. Smaller boost lets
# the formula sheet / lecture notes / definitions chunks compete on raw
