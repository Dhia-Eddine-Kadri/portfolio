"""Notes / summary generation.

The brief was very specific:
  - Length scales with document size — no shallow paragraphs for long PDFs.
  - Structured sections: Overview, Main concepts, Definitions, Theorems,
    Formulas, Examples, Exercise patterns, Common mistakes, Exam-relevant,
    Short summary.
  - Stored as markdown in `notes.content_markdown`, with source-chunk
    traceability in `note_sources`.

We pull a larger context window than ask/quiz because the model needs to
see the whole document shape to write a complete summary. Pull from every
chunk if the document is small; rank+cap for large documents.

Write a {length_cue} markdown study document strictly using the COURSE CONTEXT below.

## STEP 1: DETECT KNOWLEDGE TYPE (internal — do NOT output the classification)

Before choosing a structure, silently classify the material as one of:

- **math-heavy**: dominated by formulas, derivations, solved examples, calculation methods, proofs.
  Examples: Mathematics, Mechanics, Statistics, Physics calculations, Circuits, Thermodynamics.
- **concept-light-math**: mostly definitions, classifications, process descriptions, but small
  calculations or technical parameters may appear.
  Examples: Fertigungstechnik, Materials Science, Manufacturing, Chemistry theory, Economics concepts.
- **no-math**: purely conceptual — no formulas. Student needs to understand, remember, compare,
  argue, or explain.
  Examples: History, Law, Political Science, Literature, Philosophy, Management, Languages.
- **balanced**: both conceptual theory AND formulas/calculations are central.
  Examples: Physics, Economics, Chemistry, Engineering Science, Finance, Data Science.

## STEP 2: USE THE MATCHING STRUCTURE

### IF math-heavy:
Use these sections with `##` markdown headings — OMIT any that would be empty:

## Learning Goal
What the student should be able to do after studying this topic.

## Concept Explanation
Clear theory explanation connecting to the formulas that follow.

## Definitions
Term — precise definition. Cite source as (filename, p.N).

## Formula / Theorem Cards
Each formula in KaTeX ($...$ inline, $$...$$ display). For each: the formula, meaning of every
variable with units, conditions for use, when to use it. Cite source.

## Methods
Method 1 / Method 2 / Method 3 — when to use each. Include a decision guide:
"If the problem gives you X → use Method Y."

## Step-by-Step Solving Recipe
Topic-specific numbered steps. Not generic — tailored to the exact problem types in the material.

## Worked Example: Basic
A straightforward worked example from the material. Show every step.

## Worked Example: Exam-Style
A harder example that combines multiple concepts. Show the full solution.

## Common Mistakes
Calculation traps: sign errors, unit confusion, wrong formula choice, forgetting conditions.

## Practice Tasks
3-5 tasks at easy/medium/exam levels the student should be able to solve.

## Quick Revision Box
The 8-12 things to know cold: key formulas, method steps, special cases.

## Sources
Which files and pages were used.

### IF concept-light-math:
Use these sections with `##` markdown headings — OMIT any that would be empty:

## Learning Goal
What the student should be able to do after studying this topic.

## Definition
Core definitions quoted near-verbatim. Cite source as (filename, p.N).

## Course Classification
Where this topic fits in the broader course structure.

## Main Categories / Subtypes
All categories, subcategories, groups. List completely — do not omit groups.

## Important Source Details
Key facts, properties, parameters, DIN norms from the material.

## Comparison Table
Markdown table comparing types, methods, or concepts. Columns like:
Type | Principle | Application | Advantage | Disadvantage | Exam clue.

## Process Steps
Step-by-step process descriptions where applicable.

## Selection Criteria
How to choose the right method/material/process for a given scenario.

## Applications
Real-world applications and typical use cases from the material.

## Advantages / Disadvantages
Structured pros and cons for each method or concept.

## Common Mistakes
Confusing similar terms, wrong classifications, incomplete lists.

## Exam Questions with Model Answers
3-5 questions that can be inferred from the material, with model answer structure:
Define it. Classify it. Compare it. Choose the right process. Explain why.

## Sources
Which files and pages were used.

### IF no-math:
Use these sections with `##` markdown headings — OMIT any that would be empty:

## Learning Goal
What the student should be able to do after studying this topic.

## Simple Explanation
Plain-language overview in 3-5 sentences.

## Key Terms
Term + definition pairs. Cite source as (filename, p.N).

## Background / Context
Historical, legal, social, or theoretical background.

## Main Ideas
The 3-6 most important ideas, arguments, or theories.

## Argument Map / Timeline / Rule Structure
Choose the most fitting structure for the topic: timeline, argument map, cause-effect,
rule-exception, concept hierarchy, theory comparison. Use markdown formatting.

## Comparison of Viewpoints or Concepts
Markdown table or structured comparison of different perspectives.

## Examples
Concrete examples from the material that illustrate the concepts.

## Common Misunderstandings
What students typically get wrong about this topic.

## Exam Answer Structure
How to write an exam answer for this topic:
1. Define key term, 2. Give context, 3. Explain main idea, 4. Add example/evidence,
5. Compare or evaluate, 6. Conclude clearly.

## Model Answer
A sample exam answer demonstrating the structure above.

## Self-Check
3-5 questions the student should be able to answer. Include expected keywords.

## Sources
Which files and pages were used.

### IF balanced:
Use these sections with `##` markdown headings — OMIT any that would be empty:

## Learning Goal
What the student should be able to do after studying this topic.

## Big Picture
How the concepts and formulas in this topic connect.

## Theory Explanation
Core principles, assumptions, conditions. Cite source as (filename, p.N).

## Definitions
Term — precise definition. Cite source.

## Formula Cards
Each formula in KaTeX. For each: the formula, meaning of every variable, conditions, when to apply.

## When to Use Each Formula
Decision guide linking problem type to formula choice.

## Conceptual Example
An example that tests understanding of the theory (explain, compare, interpret).

## Calculation Example
A worked example with full numeric/symbolic solution. Show every step.

## Mixed Exam Example
A task that requires: explain the concept → calculate → interpret the result.

## Common Mistakes
Both conceptual mistakes and calculation mistakes.

## Exam Checklist
What to know: key definitions, formulas, method selection, interpretation patterns.

## Practice Tasks
One conceptual, one calculation, one mixed task.

## Sources
Which files and pages were used.

## RULES FOR ALL TYPES:
1. Use ONLY material from the context. Do NOT invent.
2. Inline citations like (filename, p.N) on every non-trivial claim.
3. If a section has no material in the context, OMIT it entirely — don't fabricate.
4. Math in KaTeX.
5. Match the language of the source.
6. Do NOT write "No formula found" or "keine vorhanden". If a section type does not
   apply to this knowledge type, simply omit it and use the correct sections instead.
