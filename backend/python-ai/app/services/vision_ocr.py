"""Phase 12 — OCR / vision fallback for image-only PDF pages.

Pipeline:

    PDF page → rendered image → vision-capable LLM → Markdown text

Only runs when:
  * ``settings.vision_ocr_enabled`` is True (env: ``MINALLO_VISION_OCR_ENABLED``)
  * the Phase 11 detector flagged ``ocr_recommended``
  * the rendering library (``pypdfium2``) is importable

Otherwise the function returns an empty mapping and the indexer keeps
the original (possibly empty) pdfminer text. The whole module degrades
gracefully when:
  * pypdfium2 is not installed (no dep is forced on the deploy)
  * OpenAI vision returns an error
  * a single page render fails

Page indices in/out are 0-based to match ``extract_pages_text``'s slot
ordering.

    "You are an OCR + structure extraction system. The user will send a "
    "single page image from a course PDF (university engineering / "
    "physics / math). Extract every readable line of text, math, and "
    "diagram labels into clean Markdown.\n"
    "\n"
    "RULES (read every one):\n"
    "1. Use ATX headings (#, ##) for visually-large headings. The page "
    "   banner (department / institution name) is NOT a heading — only "
    "   the actual content section title is.\n"
    "2. Wrap every formula in $$ ... $$ display math fences. Use proper "
    "   LaTeX: `\\frac{a}{b}` for fractions (NEVER write a fraction as "
    "   `a/b` if the source shows a horizontal fraction bar). Subscripts "
    "   use `_`: `A_S`, `E_M`, `\\delta_K`. Superscripts use `^`: `d^2`. "
    "   Greek letters use TeX commands: `\\tau`, `\\sigma`, `\\delta`, "
    "   `\\mu`, `\\pi` (NOT raw Unicode τ σ δ μ π).\n"
    "3. For two-column FORMULA-LABEL tables (typical of German Formelzettel), "
    "   emit each row as the formula on one line, immediately followed by "
    "   its German/English label on the next. Example:\n"
    "\n"
    "       $$ \\delta_K = \\frac{l'_K}{E_S \\cdot A_N} $$\n"
    "       Nachgiebigkeit des Schraubenkopfes / resilience of the bolt head\n"
    "\n"
    "       $$ \\delta_G = \\frac{0.5 \\cdot d}{E_S \\cdot A_3} $$\n"
    "       Nachgiebigkeit des eingeschraubten Gewindeteils / resilience of the engaged thread\n"
    "\n"
    "4. For decomposition / sum formulas — the sum sign and ALL its "
    "   named terms must appear on the same line:\n"
    "\n"
    "       $$ \\delta_S = \\delta_K + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\delta_i + \\delta_G + \\delta_M $$\n"
    "\n"
    "   Never substitute a sub-term's value into the sum (e.g. do NOT "
    "   write `\\delta_S = G \\cdot d / E_S + ...` — `\\delta_K` is a "
    "   symbol, not its definition).\n"
    "5. For case-based formulas (A_ers etc., where the formula depends "
    "   on which inequality is satisfied), render each case as its own "
    "   formula block with the condition above it:\n"
    "\n"
    "       Case: $D_A \\leq d_W$\n"
    "       $$ A_{ers} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}(D_A^2 - d_h^2) $$\n"
    "\n"
    "6. Preserve bullet lists with `-`. Preserve numerical given values "
    "   exactly: `12,5 kN` (keep the comma decimal separator if shown).\n"
    "7. If a region is genuinely unreadable (handwriting, scan artifact, "
    "   stamp obscuring text), write `[unclear]` for THAT region — do NOT "
    "   invent content. Better to skip than to hallucinate.\n"
    "8. Return Markdown only — no commentary, no JSON wrapper, no ``` "
    "   fences around the whole output.\n"
    "9. The Greek-letter rule (#2) applies ONLY when the source actually "
    "   shows a Greek glyph. An italic lowercase Latin letter (a, b, c, "
    "   d, ...) is NOT a Greek letter — it stays as itself. Do NOT promote "
    "   `a` → `\\alpha`, `b` → `\\beta`, `u` → `\\mu`, etc. Context check: "
    "   if the surrounding text uses the symbol as a regular variable name "
    "   (e.g. `a_A` 'Anziehfaktor'), keep it Latin.\n"
    "10. Keep a space between a LaTeX command and a following letter that "
    "    isn't part of the command: write `20 \\mu m`, NOT `20 \\mum`. "
    "    `\\mu` is the Greek letter μ; the trailing `m` is the unit metre, "
    "    a separate token. Same rule for `\\Omega \\cdot m`, `\\pi r`, etc.\n"
    "11. CODE on a slide / page (monospace blocks, listings, function "
    "    signatures, terminal output) → triple-backtick fenced code block "
    "    with a language tag when you can identify it. Example:\n"
    "\n"
    "        ```python\n"
    "        def bfs(graph, start):\n"
    "            visited = set()\n"
    "        ```\n"
    "\n"
    "    Preserve indentation EXACTLY — code semantics depend on it. Never "
    "    wrap code in `$...$` math fences. Inline identifiers in running "
    "    prose (e.g. \"the variable `count` holds…\") use single backticks. "
    "    Language tags to use when recognizable: python, java, c, cpp, "
    "    csharp, javascript, typescript, sql, bash, html, css, rust, go, "
    "    matlab, r. If the language is unclear, omit the tag but still use "
    "    the triple-backtick fence."

    "value when clear.\n"
    "4. If a word, value, or symbol is not readable, write [unclear] at that "

    Symptom: pdfminer pulled tokens out of reading order from a multi-column

    fractions collapsed, formula→label pairs separated, short identifier
    fragments interleaved.

    Concrete case the heuristic was tuned against (Formelzettel page 8):

        ``δK = ′ lK ES ⋅ AN ′ = 0,5 ⋅ d lK δi = li ES ⋅ Ai δG = 0,5 ⋅ d ES ⋅ A3 …``

    appended to the end of the page.
