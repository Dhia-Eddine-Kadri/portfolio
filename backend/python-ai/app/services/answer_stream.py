"""Streaming variant of generate_answer.

Yields Server-Sent Event payloads as OpenAI returns tokens, then a
terminal `done` event with the full source list + token diagnostics.
The browser fetches this endpoint directly with the user's Supabase
JWT — no Netlify hop, so the connection stays open for the streaming
duration without hitting Netlify's 30s function timeout.

Event schema (newline-delimited JSON inside an SSE `data:` field):
  {"t": "Newton"}                          — token to append
  {"done": true, "sources": [...], ...}    — final metadata
  {"error": "..."}                         — fatal error
