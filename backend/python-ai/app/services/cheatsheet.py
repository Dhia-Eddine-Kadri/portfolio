"""Cheatsheet generation — Learning Agent Phase 4.

A cheatsheet is NOT a long study guide (that's notes.py). It is a dense,
exam-ready reference: the highest-value formulas, definitions and rules a
student wants on one page during revision. Two things make it a Learning
Agent feature rather than a second notes generator:

  * **Topic-Map driven.** Coverage and ordering come from the course Topic Map
    (``learning_agent.get_course_topic_map``) — high-importance topics first,
    so the densest page is spent on what matters most. An explicit ``topic``
    focuses the sheet on one area instead.
  * **Grounded retrieval.** Evidence is pooled per topic through
    ``retrieve_learning_context(purpose="cheatsheet")`` (broad fan-out), so
    every line traces back to the user's own chunks. No outside knowledge.

Output is markdown, stored via ``notes.save_note(note_type="cheatsheet")`` so
it reuses the notes table, RLS, CRUD endpoint and notes list — a cheatsheet is
just another generated document.

# A cheatsheet is dense but bounded. Generation runs ~40 tok/s on this account,
# so OUTPUT length is the main driver of latency — but INPUT evidence is nearly
# free by comparison. The Stage 0 diagnostic (scripts/diagnose_cheatsheet_source)
# showed that on a well-indexed course retrieval returns ~6 clean formula-bearing
# chunks per topic across 124 topics, yet the old caps (10 topics × top_k 3,
# 20 evidence) starved the model: it never SAW most of the formulas it was
# accused of "missing". The fix is to widen the evidence pool the model chooses
# from — not to make it write more — so the same bounded output is spent on the
# best real formulas. Output stays capped for the edge proxy's upstream timeout.
# Evidence (INPUT) is widened hard — that's the Stage 0 fix. Topic/section count
# (which drives OUTPUT length, hence wall-clock against the 45s proxy timeout) is
# raised only modestly so a full sheet still finishes in budget.
