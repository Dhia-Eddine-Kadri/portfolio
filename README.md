# StudySphere

StudySphere is a student workspace built around courses, files, AI study tools, chat, notes, and subscriptions.

The app is currently a Netlify-hosted frontend with Supabase for auth, database, and storage, plus Netlify Functions for AI, payments, admin actions, and a few chat/security-sensitive flows.

## What The Website Does Right Now

- Account auth with Supabase email/password and Google sign-in
- Course dashboard with manual subject management and course-specific file areas
- PDF viewing and PDF-based AI help
- AI side panel and chatbot-style study flows
- Lecture notes and editor tools
- Real-time-style chat UI with:
  - general rooms
  - course rooms
  - custom rooms
  - direct-message style friend rooms
- Friend search and friend list rendering
- Profile and settings pages
- Subscription UI with Stripe portal/checkout support and PayPal activation flow
- Admin user search and subscription management tools
- Small games and practice/study utility sections
- Browser extension support under `frontend/extension`

## Important Backend Endpoints

These are exposed through `netlify.toml`:

- `/api/ai`
- `/api/admin-users`
- `/api/chat-friends`
- `/api/send-chat-message`
- `/api/join-room-by-code`
- `/api/create-checkout`
- `/api/create-portal`
- `/api/verify-payment`
- `/api/stripe-webhook`
- `/api/activate-paypal-subscription`

## Security State

The project is no longer in the old wide-open Supabase stage. The current repo includes hardening work for:

- row-level security for profiles, settings, notes, rooms, messages, reactions, pins, nicknames, typing indicators, friendships, blocked users, and subscriptions
- private Supabase Storage buckets and object policies
- backend-only subscription activation/write flows
- admin authorization through backend checks and `admins` / `security_events`
- chat message sending moved behind a backend function
- chat friend list loading moved behind a backend function
- basic chat/message rate limiting
- Netlify security headers

Supabase SQL files live in `docs/` and must be run in the Supabase SQL Editor for a real deployment.

## Supabase Setup

Run these SQL files in the Supabase SQL Editor:

1. `docs/studysphere_admin_security.sql`
2. `docs/studysphere_rls_hardening.sql`
3. `docs/studysphere_storage_security.sql`
4. `docs/studysphere_chat_room_rls_patch.sql`

Without these, the website will not match the intended security model.

## Environment Variables

The current Netlify functions expect some or all of these variables:

```txt
OPENAI_API_KEY

SUPABASE_URL
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
STRIPE_PRICE_ID
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET

PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET
PAYPAL_PLAN_ID
PAYPAL_API_BASE

ALLOWED_ORIGIN

CHAT_RATE_LIMIT_MAX
CHAT_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS

AI_RATE_LIMIT_MAX
AI_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS
```

Notes:

- `PAYPAL_API_BASE` is optional and can point to sandbox for testing.
- `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` should match the production site origin.

## Local Development

There is no heavy frontend build step. The app is a static frontend plus Netlify Functions.

Typical local flow:

1. Install the Netlify CLI if needed.
2. Configure the required environment variables.
3. Run the site with:

```bash
netlify dev
```

This gives you:

- the frontend
- local function routing
- the same `/api/...` paths used in production

Opening `frontend/index.html` directly is not enough if you need functions, auth flows, or API-backed features.

## Deployment

Production is set up for Netlify:

- frontend publish directory: `frontend`
- functions directory: `backend/functions`
- redirects and security headers: `netlify.toml`

If the site is connected to Netlify, deploying the latest repo state is essentially:

```bash
netlify deploy --prod
```

In this workspace there are also helper scripts under `scripts/` for checks and deployment.

## Current Caveats

- `frontend/js/app.js` is still a compatibility-heavy file while the refactor continues.
- Some newer backend-protected flows coexist with older direct Supabase frontend calls in other parts of the app.
- The roadmap in `studysphere_code_improvement_roadmap.md` is still relevant for modular cleanup.
- AI, chat, and admin flows depend on correct Netlify and Supabase environment configuration.
